ABSTRACT INSURANCE AGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

The proposed project introduces a comprehensive web application tailored for Star Health and Allied Insurance Company, aiming to enhance customer experience, streamline agency operations, and foster efficient communication between agents and users. Key features of the proposed system include the ability for users to seamlessly apply for policies, track claims, and monitor their status. The IAMS serves as a centralized platform for managing policyholder records, agent details, policy specifics, and payment information. Special emphasisis placed on expediting health insurance claims,with a focus on providing a user-friendly interface for clients and efficient tools for insurance agents..

The system empowers clients to create and manage profiles, initiate claims electronically, and track their status in real-time. The system also benefits insurance agents by enabling a direct communication with clients through an integrated messaging system. To eliminate drawbacks from existing systems, the proposed project prioritizes transaction speed, allowing users to pay for accepted policies directly through the website and view their payment details. The implementation includes a secure login system, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access the system based on their designated roles and permissions within the agency. The project focuses specifically on health insurance, offering individual health policies and family health policies. Each policy type provides detailed information,including terms and conditions, premium amounts, age limits, and coverage details. Notably, the systemâ€™s customer service component is highlighted bythe incorporation of a dedicated Chat system. This feature is designed to assist with claims and clear customer doubts, adding an extra layer of support and engagement for users.
